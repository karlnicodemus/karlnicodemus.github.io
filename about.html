<p> My name is Karl Nicodemus, a 4th year student at Georgia Institute of Technology pursuing a B.S. in Computer Science.
    I have my concentrations in people and media, allowing me to versatile asset to any project.
    I have a strong passion in UI/UX design, mobile (iOS) development, and web development. I also have a minor in
    Mandarin Chinese. </p>

<p>Outside of the technology field, I am also a leader in the Asian-American community in Atlanta, being the president of
    the Asian American Student Association at Georgia Tech. Growing up in a small town in South Georgia, I was one of the
    few people of Asian descent, but it taught me a lot about importance of diversity and inclusion is. This is what drove
    me to become an active leader in this field by organizing conferences, meetings, and discussions throughout other
    leaders along the East Coast.</p>

<p>My goal is to use my skills as a software developer to help others. With my skills and experience with leadership and
    inclusion, I am a flexible tool to any job.
